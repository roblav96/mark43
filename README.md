## Pokemon Trading Card Browser

Thank you all at Mark43 for giving me this opportunity to show you my skill sets and creativity.

Apologies ahead of time, but **I did go a bit overboard...**

At first I had an array of Pokemon names in a simple array but then my mind wandered and I started having too much fun with it. Plus when I read 
> "consider this a freestyle"

in the `readme.md` I just had to keep going.

So I made a Pokemon Trading Card Browser, yay!
